@jasonfurman I think the interesting comparison here is less these magnitudes (agree with JF's points 1/2) and more the extent of fiscal stimulus relative to the unemployment rate. And there, we are clearly in uncharted territory: https://t.co/E7iJS65xkx
While fiscal stimulus makes zero sense right now, the 2009/10 stimulus about twice as large as this. Two problems with this comparison:\n\n1. You need to do shares of GDP, comparing nominal numbers a decade apart is not meaningful.\n\n2. Ignores 12 fiscal stimulus bills after ARRA. https://t.co/eK8FBkrGvf
